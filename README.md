# PyCerti
Using this python script, you can create certificates with text on them as you need and mail them to the required people.

## Instructions to Use:

Just place a certificate template, font file (.ttf) of the font you wish to write text with and an excel sheet(.xlsx) (having the data to be written on the certificate and email addresses to which the certificate will be mailed) in the same directory as that of the script.

Also, go through the code and check comments to know better on how to use the script.
