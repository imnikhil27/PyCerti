# PyCerti
Generate certificates (or any image) with text written as per your need.

Just place a certificate template in the same directory and an excel sheet(xlsx) to get relevant information.
Go through the code and check comments to know how to use it.

Also there is a mailNow function which will mail the file (if you want to).

PS - I made this script to generate and mail participation and winning certificates of college events. Use this if you are too lazy to do it manually.
