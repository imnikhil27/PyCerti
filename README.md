# PyCerti
Generate certificates (or any image) with text as you want with a simple python script.

Just place a certificate template in the same directory and an excel sheet(xlsx) to input names and other information.
Go through the code and check comments to make things clear.

Also there is a mailNow function which will mail the file as per your need.

PS - I made this script to generate and mail participation and winning certificates of college events. Use this if you are too lazy to do it manually
